## Assign Cookies

## 题目

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number. 

Example 1:

```
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```


Example 2:

```
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```

## 题目大意

假设你是一位很棒的家长，想要给你的孩子们一些小饼干。但是，每个孩子最多只能给一块饼干。

对每个孩子 i，都有一个胃口值 g[i]，这是能让孩子们满足胃口的饼干的最小尺寸；并且每块饼干 j，都有一个尺寸 s[j] 。如果 s[j] >= g[i]，我们可以将这个饼干 j 分配给孩子 i ，这个孩子会得到满足。你的目标是尽可能满足越多数量的孩子，并输出这个最大数值。
